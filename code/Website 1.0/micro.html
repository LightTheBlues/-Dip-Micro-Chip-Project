		<p>A <i>Controller Area Network bus</i> (CAN bus for short) is an asynchrnounous communication protocol that enables communication between CAN capable devices
		without the need for a host computer. Several versions of CAN were developed in the late 80s, but it was CAN 2.0A and CAN 2.0B that soon became the 
		industry standard for automotive applications. Today, the most commonly used version for CAN implementations is CAN-FD (Flexible Data rate), which is backwards compatible
		with 2.0.</p>

					<li>Controller Area Network (CAN) is a data communication protocol utilized for broadcasting data and managing control systems.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The CAN protocol is a cost-effective communication option with real-time capabilities suitable for complex electrical environments.Various boards support the CAN protocol.</li>
					<br>
					<li>CAN is versatile and finds applications in a wide range of fields. While initially designed for interconnecting automotive devices, it has expanded into various industries. Crucial use-cases include agricultural equipment, navigational equipment, mechanical control, aircraft fueling systems, medical instruments, maritime applications such as ships, lighting control systems, and robotics.
			For example, medical equipment manufacturers have integrated CAN into medical devices, and hospitals utilize CAN-based systems to control room components like lights, cameras, and X-ray machines.

            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <p>
                If you click "Menu" and "Start Now", you may see transmitting and receiving logs. <br>
                Those consist of timestamps, communication type - TX, RX -, ID, and some data derived from the communications. <br>
