Short description of the project
CAN communication protocols are the primary means of data communication within a vehicle's network of devices (i.e. microcontrollers, CPU’s). They transmit critical information regarding vehicle status (i.e. Engine Temps, Climate controls, ect) along to other devices to make use of such data (i.e. ECU). We will be showcasing CAN communication between a vehicle’s nodes by writing and reading serially encoded messages using the digital signal processor (dsPIC33C) via the Curiosity Board provided by MicroChip.

List of functions the software will provide (5+ per developer)
Modify firmware on the Starter kit for the DSC to be implemented on the Curiosity Development Board
Engine Information (node 1)
Wheel/ tire info (node 2)
Climate settings (node 3)
Testing pre-existing button firmware on the DSC
